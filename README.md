# wavvy
A temperature control front end for Wave devices.

This currently requires the following:
* `export FLASK_APP=wavvy`
* `export WEATHER_API_KEY=<api-key>`
* `export WAVVY_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>`

wherein `<api-key>` is an OpenWeatherMap API key and `<secret-key>` is something you keep super hush-hush.

For debugging set:
* `export FLASK_DEBUG=1`
